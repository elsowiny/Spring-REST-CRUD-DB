This project utilizes TOMCAT and SQL.
I have included the SQL scripts for creating the user in mySQL and populating the database.
The project is configured to the DataBase with the persistence-mysql.properties file.
--Sets up a JDBC connection.. (if you need different set up do so here)

The project also uses a DAO implementation for data persistence.
